An increasing number of colleges and universities have developed strategies for community engagement. The engagement, however, has been one-sided in that colleges and universities send students, faculty, and staff members out into the community. The current investigation sought to further broaden the definition of community engagement by exploring the benefits that can be accrued by a university when community members are encouraged to explore the cultural, intellectual, athletic, and artistic benefits that are provided in college and university campuses. The results showed that community members who have attended a campus event in the past six months had a significantly more favorable impression of the university than those who had not attended an event. The implications for town–gown relations are discussed, the applicability of these findings to public relations practice generally are explored, and the limitations to the current investigation are offered. Historically, town–gown relations have been a source of difficulty, frustration and annoyance for both the town and the university. The division between a city and a university can be traced to medieval times, when the desire to be in the city but not of it was based upon a perceived need to patrol the morals of students. Many in the university believed the city was a sink of iniquity and any students living unsupervised were certain to fall foul to its evil ways. Today, however, many colleges and universities recognize the benefits of being engaged in the community and have attempted to integrate the university into the community. Because the notion a seamless community and university has increased in popularity, the purpose of the current investigation is to explore university engagement in the community and suggest expanding the ways in which community engagement is operationalized. In order to examine a town–gown relationship, it was necessary to secure the cooperation of the president of a university and the mayor of the community in which the university was located. The lead author presented a research proposal to a president and a mayor, and both parties agreed to support the project. This particular university and community were chosen because: they have a long-standing relationship, the university was located in the community, both the university and the community are small enough that the president and the mayor interact on a semi-regular basis, the community is a suburb located within a major metropolitan mid-western city and is in close proximity to points of interest and thus not the only source of cultural, intellectual, athletic, and artistic activity,  the community has an active city government that is quick to respond to resident needs, and the town–gown relationship historically has been strained. A 42-question survey was created to examine resident attitudes toward the university that was located in the community, and resident perceptions of the relationship they have with local government. A mailed survey technique was used to collect data. A systematic sampling strategy with a random start was used to determine the residences that were surveyed. The population of resident addresses  was obtained from the city water department because it supplies water to all residences.
